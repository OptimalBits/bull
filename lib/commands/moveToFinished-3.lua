--[[
  Move job from active to a finished status (completed o failed)
  A job can only be moved to completed if it was active.
  The job must be locked before it can be moved to a finished status,
  and the lock must be released in this script.

     Input:
      KEYS[1] active key
      KEYS[2] completed/failed key
      KEYS[3] jobId key

      ARGV[1]  jobId
      ARGV[2]  timestamp
      ARGV[3]  msg property
      ARGV[4]  return value / failed reason
      ARGV[5]  token
      ARGV[6]  shouldRemove
      ARGV[7]  event data (? maybe just send jobid).

     Output:
      0 OK
      -1 Missing key.
      -2 Missing lock.

     Events:
      'completed/failed'
