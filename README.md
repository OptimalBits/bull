The fastest, more reliable redis based queue for nodejs.
Carefully written for rock solid stability and atomicity.

It uses redis for persistence, so the queue is not lost if the server goes
down for any reason.



Follow [manast](http://twitter.com/manast) for news and updates regarding this library.

Features:
---------

- Minimal CPU usage by poll free design.
- Robust design based on Redis.
- Delayed jobs.
- Retries.
- Priority.
- Concurrency.
- Pause/resume (globally or locally).

UIs:
----

There are a few third party UIs that can be used for easier administration of the queues (not in any particular order):

[matador](https://github.com/ShaneK/Matador)
[react-bull](https://github.com/kfatehi/react-bull)
[toureiro](https://github.com/Epharmix/Toureiro)

We also have an official UI which is at the moment bare bones project: [bull-ui](https://github.com/OptimalBits/bull-ui)

Install:
--------

    npm install bull

Note that you need a redis version higher or equal than 2.8.11 for bull to work properly.

Quick Guide
-----------
```javascript
var Queue = require('bull');

var videoQueue = Queue('video transcoding', 6379, '127.0.0.1');
var audioQueue = Queue('audio transcoding', 6379, '127.0.0.1');
var imageQueue = Queue('image transcoding', 6379, '127.0.0.1');

videoQueue.process(function(job, done){

  // job.data contains the custom data passed when the job was created
  // job.jobId contains id of this job.

  // transcode video asynchronously and report progress
  job.progress(42);

  // call done when finished
  done();

  // or give a error if error
  done(Error('error transcoding'));

  // or pass it a result
  done(null, { framerate: 29.5 /* etc... */ });

  // If the job throws an unhandled exception it is also handled correctly
  throw (Error('some unexpected error'));
});

audioQueue.process(function(job, done){
  // transcode audio asynchronously and report progress
  job.progress(42);

  // call done when finished
  done();

  // or give a error if error
  done(Error('error transcoding'));

  // or pass it a result
  done(null, { samplerate: 48000 /* etc... */ });

  // If the job throws an unhandled exception it is also handled correctly
  throw (Error('some unexpected error'));
});

imageQueue.process(function(job, done){
  // transcode image asynchronously and report progress
  job.progress(42);

  // call done when finished
  done();

  // or give a error if error
  done(Error('error transcoding'));

  // or pass it a result
  done(null, { width: 1280, height: 720 /* etc... */ });

  // If the job throws an unhandled exception it is also handled correctly
  throw (Error('some unexpected error'));
});

pdfQueue.process(function(job){
  // Processors can also return promises instead of using the done callback
  return pdfAsyncProcessor();
}

videoQueue.add({video: 'http://example.com/video1.mov'});
audioQueue.add({audio: 'http://example.com/audio1.mp3'});
imageQueue.add({image: 'http://example.com/image1.tiff'});
```

Alternatively, you can use return promises instead of using the `done` callback:

```javascript
videoQueue.process(function(job){ // don't forget to remove the done callback!
  // Simply return a promise
  return fetchVideo(job.data.url).then(transcodeVideo);

  // Handles promise rejection
  return Promise.reject(new Error('error transcoding'));

  // Passes the value the promise is resolved with to the "completed" event
  return Promise.resolve({ framerate: 29.5 /* etc... */ });

  // If the job throws an unhandled exception it is also handled correctly
  throw new Error('some unexpected error');
  // same as
  return Promise.reject(new Error('some unexpected error'));
});
```

A queue can be paused and resumed globally (pass `true` to pause processing for
just this worker):
```javascript
queue.pause().then(function(){
  // queue is paused now
});

queue.resume().then(function(){
  // queue is resumed now
})
```

A queue emits also some useful events:
```javascript
.on('ready', function() {
  // Queue ready for job
  // All Redis connections are done
})
.on('error', function(error) {
  // Error
})
.on('active', function(job, jobPromise){
  // Job started
  // You can use jobPromise.cancel() to abort this job.
})
.on('stalled', function(job){
  // The job was considered stalled (i.e. its lock was not renewed in LOCK_RENEW_TIME).
  // Useful for debugging job workers that crash or pause the event loop.
})
.on('progress', function(job, progress){
  // Job progress updated!
})
.on('completed', function(job, result){
  // Job completed with output result!
})
.on('failed', function(job, err){
  // Job failed with reason err!
})
.on('paused', function(){
  // The queue has been paused
})
.on('resumed', function(job){
  // The queue has been resumed
})
.on('cleaned', function(jobs, type) {
  //jobs is an array of cleaned jobs
  //type is the type of job cleaned
  //see clean for details
});
```

Queues are cheap, so if you need many of them just create new ones with different
names:
```javascript
var userJohn = Queue('john');
var userLisa = Queue('lisa');
.
.
.
```

Queues are robust and can be run in parallel in several threads or processes
without any risk of hazards or queue corruption. Check this simple example
using cluster to parallelize jobs across processes:
```javascript
var
  Queue = require('bull'),
  cluster = require('cluster');

var numWorkers = 8;
var queue = Queue("test concurrent queue", 6379, '127.0.0.1');

if(cluster.isMaster){
  for (var i = 0; i < numWorkers; i++) {
    cluster.fork();
  }

  cluster.on('online', function(worker) {
    // Lets create a few jobs for the queue workers
    for(var i=0; i<500; i++){
      queue.add({foo: 'bar'});
    };
  });

  cluster.on('exit', function(worker, code, signal) {
    console.log('worker ' + worker.process.pid + ' died');
  });
}else{
  queue.process(function(job, jobDone){
    console.log("Job done by worker", cluster.worker.id, job.jobId);
    jobDone();
  });
}
```

Important Notes
---------------

The queue aims for "at most once" working strategy. When a worker is processing a job, it will keep the job locked until the work is done. However, it is important that the worker does not lock the event loop too long, otherwise other workers could pick the job believing that the worker processing it has been stalled.


Useful patterns
---------------

####Message Queue

Bull can also be used for persistent message queues. This is a quite useful
feature in some usecases. For example, you can have two servers that need to
communicate with each other. By using a queue the servers do not need to be online
at the same time, this create a very robust communication channel. You can treat
*add* as *send* and *process* as *receive*:

Server A:
```javascript
var Queue = require('bull');

var sendQueue = Queue("Server B");
var receiveQueue = Queue("Server A");

receiveQueue.process(function(msg, done){
  console.log("Received message", msg);
  done();
});

sendQueue.add({msg:"Hello"});
```

Server B:
```javascript
var Queue = require('bull');

var sendQueue = Queue("Server A");
var receiveQueue = Queue("Server B");

receiveQueue.process(function(msg, done){
  console.log("Received message", msg);
  done();
});

sendQueue.add({msg:"World"});
```


####Returning job completions

A common pattern is where you have a cluster of queue processors that just
process jobs as fast as they can, and some other services that need to take the
result of this processors and do something with it, maybe storing results in a
database.

The most robust and scalable way to accomplish this is by combining the standard
job queue with the message queue pattern: a service sends jobs to the cluster
just by opening a job queue and adding jobs to it, the cluster will start
processing as fast as it can. Everytime a job gets completed in the cluster a
message is send to a results message queue with the result data, this queue is
listened by some other service that stores the results in a database.

## Reference

<a name="queue"/>
###Queue(queueName, redisPort, redisHost, [redisOpts])

This is the Queue constructor. It creates a new Queue that is persisted in
Redis. Everytime the same queue is instantiated it tries to process all the
old jobs that may exist from a previous unfinished session.

__Arguments__

```javascript
    queueName {String} A unique name for this Queue.
    redisPort {Number} A port where redis server is running.
    redisHost {String} A host specified as IP or domain where redis is running.
    redisOptions {Object} Options to pass to the redis client. https://github.com/mranney/node_redis
```

---------------------------------------


<a name="process"/>
#### Queue##process([concurrency,] function(job[, done]))

Defines a processing function for the jobs placed into a given Queue.

The callback is called everytime a job is placed in the queue. It is passed
an instance of the job as first argument.

If the callback signature contains the second optional `done` argument,
the callback will be passed a `done` callback to be called after the job
has been completed. The `done` callback can be called with an Error instance,
to signal that the job did not complete successfully, or with a result as
second argument as second argument (e.g.: `done(null, result);`) when the
job is successful.
Errors will be passed as a second argument to the "failed" event;
results, as a second argument to the "completed" event.

If, however, the callback signature does not contain the `done` argument,
a promise must be returned to signal job completion.
If the promise is rejected, the error will be passed as
a second argument to the "failed" event.
If it is resolved, its value will be the "completed" event's second argument.

**Note:** in order to determine whether job completion is signaled by
returning a promise or calling the `done` callback, Bull looks at
the length property of the callback you pass to it.
So watch out, as the following won't work:

```javascript
// THIS WON'T WORK!!
queue.process(function(job, done) { // Oops! done callback here!
    return Promise.resolve();
});
```

This, however, will:

```javascript
queue.process(function(job) { // No done callback here :)
    return Promise.resolve();
});
```

You can specify a concurrency. Bull will then call you handler in parallel respecting this max number.

__Arguments__

```javascript
    job {String} The job to process.
    done {Function} The done callback to be called after the job has been completed.
```

---------------------------------------

<a name="add"/>
#### Queue##add(data, opts)

Creates a new job and adds it to the queue. If the queue is empty the job
will be executed directly, otherwise it will be placed in the queue and
executed as soon as possible.

__Arguments__

```javascript
  data {PlainObject} A plain object with arguments that will be passed
    to the job processing function in job.data.
  opts {PlainObject} A plain object with arguments that will be passed
    to the job processing function in job.opts
  opts.delay {Number} An amount of miliseconds to wait until this job
  can be processed. Note that for accurate delays, both server and clients
  should have their clocks synchronized. [optional]
  opts.attempts {Number} The total number of attempts to try the job until it completes.
  opts.backoff {Number|Object} Backoff setting for automatic retries if the job fails
  opts.backoff.type {String} Backoff type, which can be either `fixed` or `exponential`
  opts.backoff.delay {String} Backoff delay, in milliseconds
  opts.lifo {Boolean} A boolean which, if true, adds the job to the right
    of the queue instead of the left (default false)
  opts.timeout {Number} The number of milliseconds after which the job
    should be fail with a timeout error [optional]
  opts.jobId {Number|String} Override the job ID - by default, the job ID is a
    unique integer, but you can use this setting to override it. If you use this option,
    it is up to you to ensure the jobId is unique. If you attempt to add a job with an
    id that already exists, it will not be added.
  returns {Promise} A promise that resolves when the job has been succesfully
    added to the queue (or rejects if some error occured). On success, the promise
    resolves to the new Job.
```

---------------------------------------


<a name="pause"/>
#### Queue##pause([isLocal])

Returns a promise that resolves when the queue is paused. A paused queue will not
process new jobs until resumed, but current jobs being processed will continue until
they are finalized. The pause can be either global or local. If global, all workers in all queue instances for a given queue will be paused. If local, just this worker will stop processing new jobs after the current lock expires. This can be useful to stop a worker from taking new jobs prior to shutting down.

Pausing a queue that is already paused does nothing.

__Arguments__

```javascript
  isLocal {Boolean} True to only pause the local worker. Defaults to false.
  returns {Promise} A promise that resolves when the queue is paused.
```

---------------------------------------


<a name="resume"/>
#### Queue##resume([isLocal])

Returns a promise that resolves when the queue is resumed after being paused.
The resume can be either local or global. If global, all workers in all queue
instances for a given queue will be resumed. If local, only this worker will be
resumed. Note that resuming a queue globally will *not* resume workers that have been
paused locally; for those, `resume(true)` must be called directly on their instances.

Resuming a queue that is not paused does nothing.

__Arguments__

```javascript
  isLocal {Boolean} True to resume only the local worker. Defaults to false.
  returns {Promise} A promise that resolves when the queue is resumed.
```

---------------------------------------


<a name="count"/>
#### Queue##count()

Returns a promise that returns the number of jobs in the queue, waiting or
paused. Since there may be other processes adding or processing jobs, this
value may be true only for a very small amount of time.

__Arguments__

```javascript
  returns {Promise} A promise that resolves with the current jobs count.
```

---------------------------------------

<a name="empty"/>
#### Queue##empty()

Empties a queue deleting all the input lists and associated jobs.

__Arguments__

```javascript
  returns {Promise} A promise that resolves with the queue is emptied.
```

---------------------------------------

<a name="close"/>
#### Queue##close()
Closes the underlying redis client. Use this to perform a graceful
shutdown.

```javascript
var Queue = require('bull');
var queue = Queue('example');

var after100 = _.after(100, function () {
  queue.close().then(function () { console.log('done') })
});

queue.on('completed', after100);
```

`close` can be called from anywhere, with one caveat: if called
from within a job handler the queue won't close until *after*
the job has been processed, so the following won't work:

```javascript
queue.process(function (job, jobDone) {
  handle(job);
  queue.close().then(jobDone);
});
```

Instead, do this:

```javascript
queue.process(function (job, jobDone) {
  handle(job);
  queue.close();
  jobDone();
});
```

Or this:

```javascript
queue.process(function (job) {
  queue.close();
  return handle(job).then(...);
});
```

__Arguments__

```javascript
  returns {Promise} A promise that resolves when the redis client closes.
```

---------------------------------------

<a name="getJob"/>
#### Queue##getJob(jobId)

Returns a promise that will return the job instance associated with the `jobId`
parameter. If the specified job cannot be located, the promise callback parameter
will be set to `null`.

__Arguments__

```javascript
  jobId {String} A string identifying the ID of the to look up.
  returns {Promise} A promise that resolves with the job instance when the job
  has been retrieved to the queue, or null otherwise.
```

---------------------------------------

<a name="clean"/>
#### Queue##clean(options)

Tells the queue remove all jobs created outside of a grace period.
You can clean the jobs with the following states: completed, wait, active,
delayed, and failed.

__Example__

```javascript
//cleans all jobs that completed over 5 seconds ago.
queue.clean(5000);
//clean all jobs that failed over 10 seconds ago.
queue.clean(10000, 'failed');
queue.on('cleaned', function (job, type) {
  console.log('Cleaned %s %s jobs', job.length, type);
});
```

__Arguments__

```javascript
  grace {int} Grace period in milliseconds.
  type {string} type of job to clean. Values are completed, waiting, active,
  delayed, and failed. Defaults to completed.
  returns {Promise} A promise that resolves with an array of removed jobs.
```

__Events__

The cleaner emits the `cleaned` event anytime the queue is cleaned.

```javascript
  queue.on('cleaned', function (jobs, type) {});

  jobs {Array} An array of jobs that have been cleaned.
  type {String} The type of job cleaned. Options are completed, waiting, active,
  delayed, or failed.
```

---------------------------------------


<a name="priorityQueue"/>
###PriorityQueue(queueName, redisPort, redisHost, [redisOpts])

This is the Queue constructor of priority queue. It works same a normal queue, with same function and parameters.
The only difference is that the Queue#add() allow an options opts.priority that could take
["low", "normal", "medium", "high", "critical"]. If no options provider, "normal" will be taken.

The priority queue will process more often higher priority jobs than lower.

```javascript
  var PriorityQueue = require("bull/lib/priority-queue");

  var queue = new PriorityQueue("myPriorityQueues");

  queue.add({todo: "Improve feature"}, {priority: "normal"});
  queue.add({todo: "Read 9gags"}, {priority: "low"});
  queue.add({todo: "Fix my test unit"}, {priority: "critical"});

  queue.process(function(job, done) {
    console.log("I have to: " + job.data.todo);
    done();
  });
```

Warning: Priority queue use 5 times more redis connections than a normal queue.

<a name="job"/>
### Job

A job includes all data needed to perform its execution, as well as the progress
method needed to update its progress.

The most important property for the user is Job##data that includes the
object that was passed to Queue##add, and that is normally used to
perform the job.

---------------------------------------

<a name="remove"/>
#### Job##remove()

Removes a Job from the queue from all the lists where it may be included.

__Arguments__

```javascript
  returns {Promise} A promise that resolves when the job is removed.
```

---------------------------------------

<a name="retry"/>
#### Job##retry()

Rerun a Job that has failed.

__Arguments__

```javascript
  returns {Promise} A promise that resolves when the job is scheduled for retry.
```

---------------------------------------

####Debugging

To see debug statements set or add `bull` to the NODE_DEBUG environment variable.

```bash
export NODE_DEBUG=bull
```
